# Food-Order-System
The purpose of this program is to assist the user to order a meal. The program would provide two types of different meals to the users. Each of these meals would have special toppings that the users can choose. The program would be able to save the order. Also, there would be two special meals of the day that the users do not have to choose toppings. The user will be able to save all their previous orders and display them if they want to order them again. Also, the program would give the users the estimated time for their current order.
